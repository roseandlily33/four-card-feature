## My process
I started with a mobile screen size first by putting each of the four containers in a row, and then added display: row, at a tablet size, and for the desktop version I made the margin bigger, and the actual box size for each of the containers bigger. 

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned

What I learned throughout this project, is that it looked more complicated than it was to stack the two in the center. It's so important to add classes and id's to make the styling easier, for example each of these had a simillar structure on the inside but all of the tops were diffferent colours, so I gave them all the same class with another class to just style the top of each box.
